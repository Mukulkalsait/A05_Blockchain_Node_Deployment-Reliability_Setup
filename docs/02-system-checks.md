# Basic System Checks

## Objective
Validate OS, kernel, CPU, memory, disk, and network state before deploying services.

## Checks Performed
- OS version and distribution
- Kernel version
- CPU architecture and cores
- Block devices and mount points
- Disk usage
- Network interfaces and IP configuration

## Why This Matters
- Confirms compatibility with blockchain clients
- Establishes a baseline for future troubleshooting
- Helps identify resource constraints early

## Observations
- OS matched expected LTS release
- Disk layout suitable for stateful workloads
- Network configuration stable with public access

## Outcome
System verified as ready for user creation and service hardening.
